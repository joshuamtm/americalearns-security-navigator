## Technical Implementation:
- All changes preserved the original single-page application structure

- Mobile-responsive design preserved

## Next Steps for Gary/AmericaLearns:
1. Review the application at `/Users/joshua/Coding/Projects/americalearns-security-navigator/index.html`
2. Provide feedback on AmeriCorps-specific requirements from state commissions
3. Consider adding state-specific compliance variations
4. Plan webinar content based on the assessment structure
5. Develop supporting materials (templates, checklists) referenced in the tool

The application is now ready for deployment and can serve AmericaLearns' 350+ nonprofit and government clients with security guidance tailored to their unique challenges.
